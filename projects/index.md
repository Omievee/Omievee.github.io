Efkt. A Social Rating Experience.

How do you judge character? Unless it's trial and error, or taking someone's word for it, you just don't know. Efkt looks to change that by allowing your colleagues and friends to rate you base on a system of 5 attributes. These 5 scores will give you an overall score. The higher your score, the better people can judge who you are as an overall person. Your effect on others matters.. What's your Efkt?
